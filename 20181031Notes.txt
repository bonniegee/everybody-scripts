Updates since last group meeting(s)

- Maggie/Shira in September worked on FileSizeTest and WhiteSpaceTest and made a few commits, but want feedback from the group.
- Bonnie added comment asking for clarification around the issue assigned to her: "verify walktree function"
- farrell took a look at 'verify getDirectory function' and added three lines of code that allow for walking and printing a source directory's contents (recursing as needed). I think the next step is, instead of printing in line 38, calling one of our other functions.


-We discussed, for now and going forward, in order to facilitate asynchronous feedback, committer/puller should specify specific lines if we want the full group to review.

farrell--lines 36-38 of validator.py
maggie--filesizetest.py and whitespacetest.py
bonnie--clarification on that issue

NEW issues for maggie/shira and farrell marked for REVIEW by group
