Everybody Scripts call 2019-02-27
Attendees: Shira, Dianne, Dorothy, Bonnie, farrell

- Continued looking at open issues
- Big Question: what should our output file be
  - discussed a general CSV format
  - created a super basic mockup of that output
  - discussed what how to phrase the headers so that we get the output we want (Has white space --> No White space, e.g.)
  - decided that output should be granular (which functions returned true and which returned false) and summary (overall, did a file pass or fail the tests)
 - returned, then, to our open issues and started revisiting with our output goal in mind.
 - commented on a bunch of open issues
 - then created some new issues
 - and then assigned those issues
  - some to individuals, and some to multiple people who were interested in pair scripting as a means of accountability and  bouncing ideas.
 
 QOTD: 
 "I'm going to say something fun."
