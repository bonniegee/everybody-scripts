Attendees: farrel, Marty, Dianne

Gave overview of process, surveyed the code we've got to date

Question: How do we comment on other people's code? We think perhaps using the
feature to generate an issue based off a particular line of code would be most
helpful and easy to keep track of. Will confirm at next meeting to ensure this
makes sense to everyone.

Dianne will add Marty to GitHub group and assign him unassigned issue

We all agreed that we should not be afraid to "break" this code. This is all
about learning things, and figuring out how to make things work, which requires
making things break.
