On call:

farrell, Dianne, Bonnie, Marty

We went through the issues and started commenting on them and/or closing them.
A few of them were requests for code review, for functions that will hopefully
eventually be integrated into `validator.py`

Next time (whenever that is), we will start integrating code into the main script.
